# Blog Entry 7: More music & coding concepts

### Effects with Loops üîÅ 
As I learned  in the previous blog post, I can alternate sounds using a for loop. In light of that, it is also possible to add effects using loops. *Use loops  the same way as before; make sure to indent  twice!*

**Panning:** determining how much sound comes from the left speaker/headphone and the right (-100 is all in the left and 100 is all in the life)

**Substrings:** partial strings out  of  larger strings with the notation `myString[startIndex, endIndex]`

**String concatenation:** it  can also be used to form longer rhythms. You can define beats  and then concatenate them like this `intro = beatString1 + beatString2` and so on. 

### The psychology of music üé∂
**Exposure effect:** "we like music that we have consciously or  unconsciously heard before." When music is repeated, the listener is more drawn to the music because the brain will "try to imagine the next note before it  is actually played." <br>
**Contrasting:** in the future when you are making music, make sure to include some elements of contrasting sections of music. New elements make the music more attractive to the listener. 

### Advanced Transitions üåä
**Snare Roll:** repeated sounds of hitting a snare drum and then increase in pitch or amplitude. (electronic music)<br>
**Looping:** repeating a section before a new section. (DJing)<br>
**Crossfading:** increase the volume of one section while increasing the volume of another. (think using `setEffect()`)<br>
**Anacrusis:** starting the beats of a new section a little early to lead into it. <br>

### insertMediaSection( )
This function is used to implement Anacrusis. The  arguments for the function are listed below:
**Clip Name** <br>
**Track Number** <br>
**Measure Number** <br>
**Start Location** <br>
**End Location**<br>

### Takeaways. ‚úçüèΩ
**Learn to be patient with your learning!** This week I learned a lot more about how music is built and  coding  practices in python, which  wasn't as hands-on  as my previous weeks. I have learned that sometimes you need to get through a patch so that later you  can apply what you learned.
