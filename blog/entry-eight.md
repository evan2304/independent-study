# Blog Entry Eight: Few more concept before my Final Product

## Randomness ‚ùì
This can help make the music created sound more "human" because the sounds can become "improvisational" due to the randomness of numbers generated. To generate a random number, use `randint()` and `from random import *` to import the random API. The arguments that are passed into `randint()` are min and max values. 

## Effects ‚ÄºÔ∏è

**Chorus:** created copies of the original sounds (varied in pitch and time) and get mixed back in. 

**Compressor:** reduces volumen of loudest sounds, ammplifies the volumen of the quitest sounds 

**Delay:** creates an echo  of the original sound 

## Peer Feedback
An oppurtunity to learn from others input and critism to eventually have a better product. *I have been practicing this by  playing some of the music I create to classmates and family, to see if the transitions I make in music are  smooth and whether it sounds good overall!* 

## Different sounds for my Final Product 
I have some foundations that I have created throughout the last few weeks, but I wanted to try some new sounds so I created this. Over the next week I will continue to add to this with clips I created previously.

## Takeaways. ü§Ø
**Take advantage of getting peer feedback!** It can make it a lot easier for you to createa great product if you ask for others opinions. That way, you have many different perspectives weighing in, resulting in an end product that covers multiple aspects that you may not have considered on your own. However, always be aware that someone else may  have a completely different vision than you! <br>
