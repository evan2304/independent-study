# Blog Entry One: Picking a Topic
### So.. What's my topic? 🤔
It was so exciting to get the freedom of Independent Study but at the same time overwhelming! To begin with, I personally wasn’t sure what direction I wanted to go. Initially, I just wanted to look at the list of topics for some inspiration, but when I was exploring, two topics really caught my eye: A-Frame and EarSketch.

### Why A-Frame? 😯
What drew me to A-Frame was the fact that I have heard so much about virtual reality but never had any experience with it. I briefly read through the introduction about the basics of how A-Frame works and then jumped right into looking at examples of projects that were created. One that really struck me was a project that is supposed to be a sheet of paper, and as a user, you can fold the sheet of paper into  [origami](http://apps.amandaghassaei.com/OrigamiSimulator/). I also considered using  [Haml](http://haml.info/) in conjunction with A-Frame, to challenge myself by writing code that doesn't look familiar to me just yet. On the other hand, I read that Haml is considered outdated by some, so I wasn't sure I wanted to go down that route. 

As much as I found these examples cool, I didn’t see the passion that I envisioned would carry me through the whole course of Independent Study. So I continued my search and stumbled across EarSketch…

### I'm going with EarSketch! 😎
EarSketch completely blew my mind. I had heard of coding music before but never seen any behind the scenes of how that even works. For the longest, I’ve wanted to learn how to DJ, but never really got round to it. So to me, this sounds like a great, probably even better alternative because I get to create the music ultimately. I have never studied music or anything of the sort, but it fascinates me to think about the components of a song that make it sound like a specific genre. I’m so excited to see what kind of tunes I can come up with, playing around in EarSketch.

Also, I don’t have extensive experience with Python, and I would like to brush up on Javascript, so this is the perfect opportunity to do that. 

### Intro to EarSketch. 🤯
Something I have already come to appreciate about EarSketch is the fact that a thorough introduction and videos are provided when you first start exploring. When I was reading through the first few tabs of introductions, I was captivated by a video that fast-forwarded through how you can add several layers to a song and revealed an end product that was so far from the start product which had a straightforward beat. The fact that EarSketch provides these videos has already made me familiar with the basics of how you navigate the program.

I also learned that what distinguishes EarSketch from other “music making programs” is the fact that because you code the music, it’s much quicker to combine several thousand clips. Also, you can use algorithms to add randomness to the sound. If you add a sound in many other programs, every time you play that sound it will be the exact same, however, in EarSketch you can make the same audio clip sound a little different every time it is played as if it were performed by humans.

### What now? 👀
During this next week, I want to think about what goals and structures I am going to set for myself during Independent Study. I would like to enjoy the freedom of roaming and tinkering, but I believe it would also be helpful for me to have some goals that I set for myself and achieve.

### Takeaways. 👩🏽‍💻
My most significant takeaway was that everything becomes a lot easier if you are passionate about it. When I decided that I wanted to do EarSketch over A-Frame, I jumped into the learning at a quicker pace and with more enthusiasm. I would advise anyone who is picking something they “ought to choose” over something they want, to choose the latter. It makes everything more accessible and fun.
