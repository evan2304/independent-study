# Blog Entry 4: Staying consistent!
It has been two weeks since my last blog post, and because it has been spring break, I realized that I didn’t keep the same consistency in learning. Instead of learning a little every day, like I do in school, I was spending longer time learning but more spread out. 

### Learning about planning and choosing sounds 🔍

**Tempo:** as mentioned in the last blog post, it is often defined as the speed of the music being played and affects the length of each beat. Different genres have different tempo intervals. Note that these intervals/ranges are not rigid, they are just a guide. E.g., the Hip Hop genre has 85-95 bpm and House has 115-130 bpm.

**Pitch:** how high or low the sound is. How humans hear the frequency of a sound. 

**Key:** a group of pitches that the music is composed in. Also defines the tonic (home note where the pitches are drawn from.) Major and minor keys have different sounds: minors tend to sound "darker."

*Tip!* To make it easier to compose music in EarSketch coherently, choose sounds that are within the same folder because they are in the same key.
 

### Transitions 🌊
The primary purpose of a transition in music is to make the listener aware that something is about to change. There are a couple of popular transitions: placing a crash cymbal on the first beat, or "making certain tracks drop out to create rests or pauses."

### About the music industry! 🎹

**Copyright:** Something so essential to keep in mind as you create is the copyright of your own and others music! Copyright defines when and where other people can use your music and vice versa. There are often two copyrights to deal with: sound recording composition (usually belongs to the record label) and composition copyright (often belongs to the songwriter).

**Fair use:** keep copyright issues from going too far, this statement is part of a "safety net." There are some instances where it makes sense for the song to be used. However, this is reviewed on a case-by-case basis.


### Takeaways. 💻
**Keep learning consistently!** It’s a lot easier to keep learning a little every day than to learn in larger chunks that are more spread out. It makes it more straightforward to keep track of all that you are learning because you won’t have to refresh your memory.
