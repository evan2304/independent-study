# Blog Entry Nine: The Grand Finale 

## Follow up from the past week 🔙
The past week I was feeling frustrated and bored with the songs I had created thus far and decided to jump ship and start something from scratch. I didn't get much further with that, so I realized that it was probably better to go back and continue the work I had worked on for longer. 

## The end product 🔊
I added more layers to a previous song I had created and ended up with an end product that I am proud of. [Click here to view](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/#?sharing=Uv4bfARcsCqF3pgYF15oLA) Click Run and then Play. <br>

In this final product, I made use of ABA form, transitions, effects, and custom functions. 

## Presentation &  Self-reflection 📝
Once I finished my end product, I started working on my final presentation, and this naturally sparked some self-reflection. I started to think about what challenges I had faced in independent study and how I would like to continue learning in the future. 

**Challenges:** 🧐
* The curriculum has so much to offer, but what do *I* want to create. Trying to navigate how to take in knowledge and make it my own. 
* The creative process was difficult because I'm not aware  of any methods of "brainstorming" or "planning out" the type of song I want. There are so many sounds out there, both on EarSketch and beyond, so I go in blindly looking what I like. 
* Being new to EarSketch, I experienced a layering threshold. Often when trying to add a third or fourth layer of sound, the music no longer sounds coherent (think banging pots and pans in a kitchen). I had to be patient and tinker until the sounds seemed more  like my vision. 

**Future aspirations:** 🎯
* Get talent on the track. There are plenty of talented singers and  rappers in our school building, so I think it would be cool to combine their talent with my creations on EarSketch. 
* Push the limits. I still struggle with the layering threshold to a certain degree, so in the future, I would like to master adding more sounds and variations on top of each other. 

## Takeaways. ✍🏽
**Be patient with your craft  and fuel it with consistency.** No matter how passionate you are about something, there will be times when you feel frustrated with what you are doing. To overcome these obstacles, you must remain consistent. Trying sticking it out and seeing if it gets any better. <br>
*“Success isn’t always about greatness. It’s about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come.”* – Dwayne Johnson
