## Blog Entry 5: Typical Form and Custom Functions

This blog post is all about tinkering! Getting comfortable applying some of the more sophisticated techniques.

**Section:**  several measures that express something similar (intros, verses, choruses, outros)<br>
**Form:** variation in sections results in a form

### Typical form 🎸

**A-B-A Form**
Intended to make a “sandwich” of variety. Section A “invokes familiarity” whereas Section B brings some spice to the mix.

Keep in mind each section can have multiple effects and several levels on numerous tracks.

Click Run and then Play. 

### Finally! Custom Functions 👩🏽‍💻
This is how I will now be able to write scripts that are a lot less repetitive! This is what I have been waiting for - if you have seen some of my past examples, there was a lot of copy pasting to repeat a sound.

When these functions are defined, they can have any number of parameters. The beauty of this kind of function is that you can lay different beats on several tracks very quickly.

*Keep in mind!* after you have `def mFunction` and named your parameters `(startMeasure, endMeasure)` you must remember to follow with a colon, and then indent the content of the function. If you forget to indent then the code will not be a part of the function!

### Takeaways. 💭
**Building is learning!** The easiest way to learn is by building. I had a hard time wrapping my mind around some concepts and ideas this week until I tinkered!  I am a visual learner so seeing how the sounds show up in the DAW as I code, helps solidify some of the musical concepts I learn.
